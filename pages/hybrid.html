    <h1>Hybrid Systems</h1>
    <p>A Hybrid Solar Solution comprises solar panels, battery energy storage as well as utility and/or generator power working together seamlessly, 24 hours a day, to provide power to your electrical appliances.
      The battery provides backup power and stores the solar-generated energy for later use–reducing your electricity bill.<br>
      Our systems include the ability to export power to the utility grid if you choose to.
      A hybrid solar system is grid-tied with battery storage. They come with a special ‘smart’ inverter that can transmit direct current (DC) power to and from your batteries, and channel alternating current (AC) power between the grid and your home when necessary.<br>
      
      Hybrid systems allow for full control over your power, while keeping you grid-connected in case of emergency. 
      Key benefits of hybrid systems<br>
      <h2>Here are some of the perks of a hybrid solar system:</h2><br>
      
      
          1. You’ll use less grid electricity than you would with a traditional grid-tied system. While hybrid setups are grid-tied, they come with solar battery storage, which means you can maximise consumption of the power generated from the panels.<br>
          2. A hybrid system is possibly the most expandable, future-ready home solar setup. With some customisable hybrid systems, you can expand capacity by buying more panels or batteries. Hybrid systems may also be compatible with newer solar technologies — for example, an electric vehicle (EV) might function as one of the ‘batteries’ in a hybrid setup.<br>
          3. For even lower costs, you can use a power management system. These technologies can automatically optimise your power usage. (For example, larger appliances like dishwashers can be switched on during peak daylight hours.) The result: bigger utility savings and a quicker ROI.<br>
          <h2>Some cons of hybrid systems:</h2><br>
      
      
          1. There’s a lot to install upfront, making the initial investment bigger. While you can budget for a smaller battery bank than with an off-grid setup, the cost still needs some thought. Specialised equipment, such as a smart hybrid inverter, adds to the price tag.<br>
          2. Lots of space might be necessary for the required parts. With grid access, you’re likely not in an isolated rural area - even so, you’ll need space for hybrid solar equipment, including the battery bank and inverters.</p>
